# Exercise 01: Safeguarding Against Injection Attacks with Validation and Sanitization

Welcome to Exercise 01 of AdvanceSecureCoding! This exercise focuses on protecting against injection attacks by implementing validation and sanitization techniques in your code.

## Overview

Injection attacks, such as SQL injection and XSS, are common security vulnerabilities. This exercise demonstrates how to mitigate these risks through proper input validation and data sanitization practices.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand the importance of input validation and data sanitization in preventing injection attacks.
- Learn practical techniques to implement validation and sanitization in different programming languages.
- Explore real-world scenarios and examples to reinforce secure coding principles.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get started with the exercise:

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine.
